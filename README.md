# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Wine Quality test

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important step in data analysis which focuses on understanding **patterns, trends, and relationships** through statistical tools and visualizations.  

Python offers various libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** which enable effective exploration and insights generation to help in further modeling and analysis.  

In this project, we will perform EDA on the **Zomato dataset** to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

## ðŸš€ Key Steps in EDA  

### Step 1: Importing Required Libraries  
We use the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas** â†’ For data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** â†’ For numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** â†’ For static visualizations  
- **Seaborn** â†’ For advanced statistical plots  
- **Plotly** â†’ For interactive visualizations

### Step 2: Data Cleaning  
- Handling **missing values**  
- Removing **duplicates**  
- Renaming and formatting **column names**  
- Checking for **outliers**  

---

### Step 3: Data Exploration  
- Checking dataset **shape and size**  
- Summarizing dataset with `.info()` and `.describe()`  
- Understanding categorical and numerical features  
- Finding **unique values** and distributions  

---

### Step 4: Data Visualization  
We will use **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** to visualize:  
- Distribution of ratings, prices, and cuisines  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Bar charts and histograms  
- Voiln chat  
- Interactive charts with Plotly

### ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow  
1. Import necessary libraries  
2. Load the Wine dataset  
3. Clean and preprocess the data  
4. Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis  
5. Visualize findings  
6. Summarize insights

## âœ… Conclusion  
EDA helps in identifying **hidden patterns, key trends, and potential outliers** in the dataset. This analysis forms the foundation for further **machine learning modeling and business insights**.
